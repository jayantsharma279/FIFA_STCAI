Why PostgreSQL over NoSQL Databases in this case?
In this dataset, we are provided with a stuctured dataset in which a data can be filled in the columns. For such data (e.g., clubs, ages, structured data, and statistical queries), PostgreSQL is generally the better choice. It provides strong schema enforcement, complex querying capabilities, and ACID compliance, making it ideal for handling structured data and analytical queries reliably and efficiently.
NoSQL might be overkill, as it is graph database, it might not be the best tool for this dataset. Unless the data becomes highly unstructured or we need extreme scalability as a part of the functionality.

### Model and Hyperparameter Choices
- **Spark**
- Random Forest: This model was chosen because of its ability to handle high-dimensional data and complex, nonlinear relationships effectively. It combines predictions from multiple decision trees, which reduces overfitting. This approach helps the model generalize well on the test data, resulting in more accurate predictions. The hyper parameters we tuned for this model were the number of trees and the maximum depth of each tree. We tuned the number of trees to find a balance between accuracy and computation time and we tuned the max depth as to maximize accuracy without overfitting on the test data.
  
- Linear Regression: Although this model is simple, it trains data quickly and is computationally efficient. Similarly to the random forest regressor, this model generalizes well on test data. The hyperparameters we decided to tune were the maximum number of iterations as well as the regularization parameter. The Max-Iter parameter represents the maximum number of iterations the optimizer will step to reach the solution. More steps may lead to a higher accuracy but this can increase the training time. The second hyperparameter that was tuned was Reg-Param which helps prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to large coefficients in the model but it can encourage underfitting if the Reg-Param value is too small. As a result, this hyperarameter was chosen to tune such that accuracy was maximised and overfitting was minimized.
  
- **Pytorch**
- Mulit-Layer-Perceptron: In this multi layer perceptron we used 4 hidden layers with 128 nodes in each layer. We chose that structure because it was a deep neural network that captures the complexities of the dataset efficiently. The hyperparameters we chose to tune for this model were the learning rate and number of epochs. The learning rate was decreased from 0.05 to 0.005 so that the model achieves a more stable solution without overshooting. The number of epochs were increased from 10 to 20 s
  
- Linear Regression: This model was again chosed because it is computationally efficient, trains quickly, and generalizes well on test data. We tuned two key hyperparameters: the optimizer and the learning rate. Switching the optimizer to ADAM helps the model converge faster and handles noisy gradients effectively, improving performance. Adjusting the learning rate allowed us to control the step size of each iteration—balancing faster training with stability. By fine-tuning the learning rate, we aimed to achieve optimal accuracy without overfitting.
